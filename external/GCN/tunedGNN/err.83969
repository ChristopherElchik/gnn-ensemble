The weights_only Unpickler might not support all instructions implemented by this protocol, please file an issue for adding support if you encounter this.

    raise pickle.UnpicklingError(_get_wo_message(str(e))) from None
_pickle.UnpicklingError: Weights only load failed. In PyTorch 2.6, we changed the default value of the `weights_only` argument in `torch.load` from `False` to `True`. Re-running `torch.load` with `weights_only` set to `False` will likely succeed, but it can result in arbitrary code execution. Do it only if you got the file from a trusted source.
Please file an issue with the following so that we can make `weights_only=True` compatible with your use case: WeightsUnpickler error: Unsupported operand 149

Check the documentation of torch.load to learn more about types accepted by default with weights_only https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.load.html.
